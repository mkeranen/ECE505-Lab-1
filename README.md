# ECE505-Lab-1

This lab focuses on exploring basic microprocessor fundamentals such as registers, memory, flags, etc. Registers and flags are traced
through code written in ARM Assembly that involves LED loops and arithmatic operations.

Hardware:
 - Tiva™ C Series TM4C123GH6PM Microcontroller
 - ARM® Cortex®-M4F Based MCU TM4C123G LaunchPad™
 
Software:
 - ARM Assembly
